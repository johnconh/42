## Cybersecurity _(1.0)_

In order to create a basic functional website, here are a few security concerns that you have to tackle:
- Any password stored in your database, if applicable, must be hashed.
- Your website must be protected against SQL injections/XSS.
- If you have a backend or any other features, it is mandatory to enable an HTTPS connection for all aspects (Utilize wss instead of ws...).
- You must implement some form of validation for forms and any user input, either within the base page if no backend is used or on the server side if a backend is employed.

Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm.

For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env variables etc... must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by git. Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure of the project.
